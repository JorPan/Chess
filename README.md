# Chess, you say?! 

This app utilizes chessboardjsx and chess.js to create a very mediocre chess opponent. 

Clone this repo, open it in your code editor, run "npm i" to install dependencies, and "npm start" to play. 

The computers moves are randomly generated, sooooo have fun beating a 4 year old at chess!
